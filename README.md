# Design Choices:

## Color Scheme: 
The website uses a combination of white and various shades of blue as the primary color scheme, which creates a clean and professional appearance.
Primary color - [#FFFFFF]
Secondary color - [#FF5555]

## Typography: 
It employs a clear and legible font for the text content, ensuring easy readability.
Font style used- Roboto Condensed, a google font which looks similar to the reference.

## Layout: 
The layout appears to be responsive. It seems to follow modern design principles with organized sections and clear navigation.

## Visual Elements: 
Minimalistic design is apparent with simple, well-defined shapes and icons used sparingly to enhance visual appeal without overwhelming the content.

# Libraries/Technologies:

## React: 
The website is likely built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage state.
## Next.js: 
Next.js, a React framework, might have been used for server-side rendering, routing, and other optimizations. It simplifies the React development process and improves performance.
## Tailwind CSS: 
Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, could have been used for styling. It provides pre-defined utility classes that make it easier to create custom designs without writing CSS from scratch.
## Vercel: 
The website is deployed on Vercel, a platform for deploying and hosting static sites, serverless functions, and full-stack applications. Vercel offers seamless integration with Next.js and other popular frameworks.
